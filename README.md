## Model details

What's being modelled is a set of lecturers and a set of students, where the lecturers allocate coursework and a limited amount of extracurricular work, and students accept these responsibilities and discharge them appropriately.

A student should be given a set of coursework of fairly high importance, requiring resources such as time and either essays produced or code written. Lecturers should then give out time-sensitive responsibilities, either writing research code or producing a paper.

Comparisons are made between models where these agents are "responsible", and agents where no responsibility formalism is introduced. Extra-curricular work should be performed better when modelled in the responsible setting.
