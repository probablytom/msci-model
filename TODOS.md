* Ask Tim: with the Theatre actor model, how do we know when a task is completed? Once
  that task is completed, how do we check its return value?
* Got to ad responsibilities to the task queue? What are the dangers in
  circumventing the Theatre task model?
* Does the Task constructor actually need to be passed a Workflow class?
* What do we do if no action can discharge an accepted responsibility?
* When choosing a responsibility, implement an Eisenhower matrix so as to
  account for urgency against importance
* When choosing a responsibility, be smarter than just taking the mean of
  its importances
* ASK TIM: what is the condition on the while loop for?!?!?! How should I be
  writing it?
